# Dice-game
This is a simple, two-player dice game called Pig where the first player to reach 100 points or more wins. Each player (one human and one computer) gets a turn when the other player gets a 1 on the dice. If any number between 2-6 shows up, then the player can either roll again or keep their turn where the total points are the sum of the numbers appeared on the dice on every turn.
